📊 Sort Algorithm Comparison

An interactive and educational React + TypeScript application that visualizes and compares multiple sorting algorithms in real-time. This tool is designed to help users understand the inner workings of various sorting techniques through dynamic animations and user-friendly controls.​
🚀 Features

    Visualize Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort (Randomized), Heap Sort, and Counting Sort.

    Custom Input: Manually input arrays or generate random ones.

    Real-Time Timer: Track the duration of sorting processes with a dynamic timer.

    Algorithm Selection: Choose which algorithm to visualize using intuitive buttons.

    Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.

    Educational Insights: Understand how different algorithms operate and compare their efficiencies.​
